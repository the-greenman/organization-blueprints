## Skills for new organizations

A blueprint is sets of completentary practices that work together to provide an effecive foundation for a  highly functional organization.  The Blueprint project seeks to make it easier to create a better workplace, by sharing sets of systems that work at  "all levels" of an organization. The Blueprints are open source, shared as creative commons and encourage anyone to take part, take them apart, rework and share back. 

Better organizations are a vital component in building a future that works. Creating these organizations is hard work, it requires a whole new concept of leadership and cooperation, but it also needs the right tools, technologies and methodologies in place. The intention of the Blueprint project is to provide a set of practical frameworks that can work to get an organization into the right place for the internal changes in understanding to arise. 

## How is this better than an existing system? 

Active question: What does this do that something like Sociocracy 3.0 does not do?
