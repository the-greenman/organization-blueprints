## The 6 Dynamics

### 1: Direction

The power of direction allows a group to focus their energy. It defines what kinds of roles and actions are valued and the scope for their application. 

_Questions To Be Answered, Story mapping, Jobs to be done, Problem definition_


### 2: Production

The means of production and resource allocation defines what kinds of work is possible. This power is able to manage what kinds of input and output are valued.

_Iterative practices, Agile, Lean, retrospectives, Roadmapping, Digital skills_


### 3: Memory
“We do things this way because it’s what works.” A true learning organization can be established by allowing existing practices to be challenged, and evolved through an emergent, communal aesthetic.

_Style guides, pattern based working, assumptions, knowledge sharing_

### 4: Process
How work is actually undertaken through process, control and regulation. When processes can be evolved and updated, an organization will be able to adopt new technologies and practices.

_Meeting facilitation techniques, card based working, advice process, automation_

### 5: Authority
How authority is exercised and how decisions can be overruled defines an organisation’s ability to adapt to new situations. When data and evidence can override seniority, new ideas can take root. 

_Test and See, Multivariate testing, circles and roles_

### 6: Trust

Trust powers the emotional structure of an organization. Trust and the emotional connections at all levels of an organization need to be actively maintained to ensure that the human environment is healthy and promotes engagement. 

_Peer contracts, non-violent communication, difficult conversations_
