## The 6 Power Dynamics

*The six dynamics are a model of primary types of power within an organization. A high functioning, next-stage organization needs to be capable in all these areas. The purpose of the blueprints is to identify key concepts and practices that develop organizational capabilities, creating workplaces that better harness the unique, diverse skills of their members.*

The six types of power are based on the first six stages of Spiral Dynamics. Each of the levels is equally important.


### 1: Direction

### 2: Production

The means of production and resource allocation defines what kinds of work is possible. This power is able to manage what kinds of input and output are valued.

#### Concepts
* Iterative working
* Roadmaps 
* Digital skills
* Agile
* Lean

#### Practices
* Kanban
* scrum


### 3: Memory
“We do things this way because it’s what works.” A true learning organization can be established by allowing existing practices to be challenged, and evolved through an emergent, communal aesthetic.

#### Concepts
* Style guides
* Patterns
* Assumptions
* Knowledge sharing

#### Practices


### 4: Process
How work is actually undertaken through process, control and regulation. When processes can be evolved and updated, an organization will be able to adopt new technologies and practices.

#### Concepts
* Meeting facilitation techniques
* card based working
* automation

#### Practices 
* advice process
* Holacracy meeting types

### 5: Authority
How authority is exercised and how decisions can be overruled defines an organisation’s ability to adapt to new situations. When data and evidence can override seniority, new ideas can take root. 

#### Concepts
* Test and See

#### Practices
* The circle way
* Holacracy roles 

### 6: Trust

Trust powers the emotional structure of an organization. Trust and the emotional connections at all levels of an organization need to be actively maintained to ensure that the human environment is healthy and promotes engagement. 

#### Concepts

#### Practices
